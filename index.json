That’s why I transitioned from an electrical engineering background to data analytics. To me, data science is a way to use my detail-oriented and logical way of thinking to solve real problems and derive impact across almost any sector. My ultimate goal is to be able to learn about different businesses and help them make better data-driven decisions.\nI truly enjoy working with people and as part of a team. Throughout my studies, I have worked across many different teams, consisting of researchers and students. Therefore, I am comfortable in presenting my findings in meetings by adjusting the level of details in the presentation according to my audience.\nI completed my master\u0026rsquo;s in September 2021 from McMaster University. I have over two years of analytical experience in deriving insights from large data sets. Moreover, I have worked with massive Electronic Health Records (EHR) such as the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS), Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) from the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI), and Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) survey-based data sets.\nI have applied my analytics skills on a variety data sets.

ALC has numerous negative implications on patient health and the health care system. Early identification of patients who are at risk of becoming ALC could help decision-makers better manage the situation and alleviate this problem. This thesis evaluates the use of various ML algorithms in predicting ALC at two different time points in the patient’s trajectory. Moreover, it identifies the most important predictors of ALC in each time point and provides insights on how adding more information, at the expense of time for decision-making, would improve the predictive accuracy.\nIn this study, ML methods were deployed using retrospective electronic health records. Our research is comprised of two separate algorithms at two different time points in the patient’s journey. The figure below presents the overview of the two algorithms. The first algorithm is carried in the ED stage and uses predictors available before admission to acute care hospital to predict delayed discharge in the hospital. The second algorithm uses a combination of predictors in both ED and hospital to predict the same outcome.\nThe work here was my master\u0026rsquo;s thesis for the degree master of science in computational science \u0026amp; engineering from McMaster University.\n","date":1631232000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1631232000,"objectID":"1a8abda1a27e1067590c8d46ff045b27","permalink":"https://farazahmadi.github.io/project/alc-thesis/","publishdate":"2021-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/alc-thesis/","section":"project","summary":"MSc thesis project, working on imbalanced classification on large data sets in different time points.","tags":["R","imbalanced classification","EHR"],"title":"Machine Learning Predictions of Alternate Level of Care (ALC) in Canada: From Emergency Department to the in-Hospital Stage","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The goal of this project was to understand the segments that are struggling with their health and wellness as a result of the pandemic, and the types (or themes) of struggles they are facing or main areas of concern in order to recommend the types of supplemental services or partnerships.\nThe project was proposed by RBC Insurance as the final project for the MBA course I was taking in Fall 2020.
